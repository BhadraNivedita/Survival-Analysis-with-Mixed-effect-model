Survival analysis in the context of biological sciences is a statistical approach used to analyze and interpret the time until an event of interest, such as death, disease progression, or recovery, occurs. This method allows researchers to handle censored data—where the exact time of the event is not observed for all subjects—enabling the estimation of survival probabilities and the identification of factors that influence the event timing. Survival analysis is crucial for understanding the dynamics of biological processes and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in clinical trials.
